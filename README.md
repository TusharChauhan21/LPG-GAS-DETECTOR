# TECHNICAL PROJECT REPORT

### Title of Invention / Project:

### LPG Gas Detector


## Brief Abstract :

Our project is solving the problem of gas leakage. The gas leakage is one of the most hazardous problem in the whole world. Gas leakage is one of the reason which leads to increase in global warming. It is also a cause for major health problem (asthma and other respiratory problems).

For solving the above problems, awareness of the impact of gas leaks is a first step and next step is working on developing powerful gas detector which can detect different type of gas that&#39;s why we have made gas detector which can detect different type of harmful as well as non harmful gas.

In order to aware people about gas leakage GSM device can be installed in order to improve the detector.


#
### Novel/Additional modifications that you can propose to improve upon drawbacks:

We have used many buzzers to produce sound whenever gas is detected, but instead of that we can use a loud speaker that may produce a loud sound to create awareness about gas leakage, as well as we can install GSM model in it to create awareness through mobile alert message about gas leakage.

#
## Advantages

- Detection and prevention of any sort of gas leakage.
- The sensor has excellent sensitivity combined with a quick fast response time.
- The sensitivity of the GAS Sensor can be adjusted according to environment.
